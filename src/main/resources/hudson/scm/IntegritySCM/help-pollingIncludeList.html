	Polling include filter is a comma separated list of regex expressions for file names or file extensions.
	During SCM polling only files that match one of these expressions are taken into consideration for changes.
	Example .*\.c, .*\.h, Foo\.java<br/>
	<b>Note: to match for '.' and other characters that are regex meta characters, use '\' to escape, e.g.: '.*\.txt'</b>
